Web audio analyzer and MIR application

This is a web application, part of my bacherlor's thesis project, that allows to analyse and visualise some important properties of a digital audio signal.

These properties are called audio descriptors (or audio features) and are fundamental for scientific community that work on analysis technologies, audio processing and content-based research on multimedia databases and digital music (MIR â€“ music information retrieval).

Thanks to the web-based implementation and to the high level JavaScript programming language, that features some specific functions for audio manipulation (with Web Audio API), this application can execute on the majority of the devices, desktop and mobile, just using a browser. The application is targeted towards a vast audience, that consists of researchers but also of professionals and enthusiasts of the music production industry, that nevertheless need the information gathered from the audio features, used to a more user-friendly software environment, away from most low-level frameworks specifically developed for the industry or the academic world.
